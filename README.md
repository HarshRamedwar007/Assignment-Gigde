## Project Overview
**Assignment-Gigde** is a task management application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) with user authentication and task/project management features. This app allows users to register, login, create, manage, and delete tasks and projects. Each user can have up to 4 projects at a time, and all interactions are secured with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration using JWT.
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete tasks and projects.
- **Multi-user Support**: Each user can manage up to 4 projects.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS for a smooth user experience.
- **Project and Task Management**: Users can organize tasks within projects and manage them efficiently.
